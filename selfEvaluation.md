# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?  
***I feel relatively confident. This will clearly get more complicated!***
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?  
***The struggle was mostly productive, though googling still frustrates me. I would like to work on my pateince and efficiency here.***
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?  
***Mostly googling and typing speed. Both are already in the calendar!***
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?  
***I still am confused about some of the functions, how each is called, which use parenthesis, which include periods, etc. Need to keep studying and compiling my vocab lists.***
